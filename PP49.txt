Solution for PP49:

INPUT:
#triplet ie n=3
#hence we require three for loops
s=5 #for simplicity #we can also input sum from user
arr1=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
for a in arr1:
    for b in arr1:
            for c in arr1:
                    if(a+b+c==s):
                        print(a)
                        print(b)
                        print(c)
                        print("--------")
