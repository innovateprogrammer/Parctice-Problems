Solution for PP42:
 

INPUT:
arr1=[0,0,1,0,0] # for instance
a=0 #simple for counting zeros
b=0 #simple for count 1
for i in arr1:
    if(i==0):
        a+=1
    else:
        b+=1 # as array contains only zeros or ones
#LOgic
#The length of the largest sub array containing equal amount of 0's and 1's will be twice the min count of a nd b
r=min(a,b)
print(r*2) # ie r number of 1 + r num of 0 hence mul by 2
