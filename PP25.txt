INPUT:
arr=[3,1,3,3,2]  #n=5 #you can accept number from the users
n=len(arr)
arr1=[]
max=count=0
for i in arr:
    if i not in arr1:
        arr1.append(i)
for h in arr1: #check the number 
    for g in arr:
        if(g==h):
            count+=1
    if(count>(n//2)):  #going by their logic although there are many ways
        max=h
        break
        
print(max)
